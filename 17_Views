Views

In SQL, a view is an alternative way of representing data that exists in one or more tables. 
Just like a real table, it contains rows and columns. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. 
Though views can be queried like a table, views are dynamic; only the definition of the view is stored, not the data.

How does the syntax of a CREATE VIEW statement look?

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

How does the syntax of a REPLACE VIEW statement look?

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

How does the syntax of a DROP VIEW statement look?

DROP VIEW view_name;
