SQL Statements are used for interacting with Entities (that is, tables), Attributes (that is, columns) and their tuples (or rows with data values) in relational databases. 
SQL statements fall into two different categories: Data Definition Language statements and Data Manipulation Language statements. 

Data Definition Language (or DDL) statements are used to define, change, or drop database objects such as tables. 
Common DDL statement types include CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, and DROP. 
CREATE: which is used for creating tables and defining its columns; 
ALTER: is used for altering tables including adding and dropping columns and modifying their datatypes; 
TRUNCATE: is used for deleting data in a table but not the table itself; 
DROP: is used for deleting tables. 

Data Manipulation Language (or DML) statements are used to read and modify data in tables.
These are also sometimes referred to as CRUD operations, that is, Create, Read, Update and Delete rows in a table. 
Common DML statement types include INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
INSERT: is used for inserting a row or several rows of data into a table;
SELECT: reads or selects row or rows from a table; 
UPDATE: edits row or rows in a table;
DELETE: removes a row or rows of data from a table.
