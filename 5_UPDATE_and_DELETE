After a table is created and populated with data, the data in a table can be altered with the UPDATE statement. 
The UPDATE statement is one of the data manipulation language or DML statements. 
DML statements are used to read and modify data. 

Based on the author entity example, we created the table using the entity name Author and the entity attributes as the columns of the table. 
Rows were added to the Author table to populate the table. 
Sometime later, you want to alter the data in the table. 
To alter or modify the data in the Author table, we use the UPDATE statement. 
The syntax of the UPDATE statement looks like this, UPDATE [TableName] SET [ColumnName] = [Value] ]> <WHERE [Condition] >.
In the statement, TableName identifies the table. The ColumnName identifies the column value to be changed, as specified in the <WHERE [Condition] >.

Example:
You want to update the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME of the author with AUTHOR_ID A2 from Mike Ross to Harvey Specter. 
To see the UPDATE statement in action, we start by selecting all rows from the author table to see the values. 
To change the first name and last name to Harvey Specter where the AUTHOR_ID = A2, enter the UPDATE statement as follows. 
UPDATE AUTHOR SET LAST NAME = SPECTER, FIRST NAME = HARVEY WHERE AUTHOR_ID = A2. 
Now, to see the result of the update, select all rows again from the Author table and you will see that in row to the name changed from Mike Ross to Harvey Specter.

Note that if you do not specify the WHERE clause, all the rows in the table will be updated. 
In this example, without specifying the WHERE clause all rows in the table would have changed the first and last names to Harvey Specter.

Sometime later, there might be a need to remove one or more rows from a table. 
The rows are removed with the DELETE statement. 

The DELETE statement is one of the data manipulation language statements used to read and modify data. 
The syntax of the DELETE statement looks like this, DELETE FROM [TABLEName] <WHERE [Condition] >. 
The rows to be removed are specified in the WHERE condition. 
Based on the author entity example, we want to delete the rows for AUTHOR_ID A2 and A3. 

Example:
DELETE FROM AUTHOR WHERE AUTHOR_ID IN ('A2','A3').
Note that if you do not specify the WHERE clause, all the rows in the table will be removed. 
Now you can identify the syntax of the UPDATE statement and DELETE statement and explain the importance of the WHERE clause in these statements.
