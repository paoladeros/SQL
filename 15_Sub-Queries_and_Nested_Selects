 Sub-queries or sub selects are like regular queries but placed within parentheses and nested inside another query.
 This allows you to form more powerful queries than would have been otherwise possible. 
 
 How does a typical Nested SELECT statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);
