There are several ways to access multiple tables in the same query. 
Namely, using Sub-queries, Implicit JOIN, and JOIN operators, such as INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.


Implicit version of CROSS JOIN (also known as Cartesian Join) statement syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2;
CROSS JOIN table2;


Implicit version of INNER JOIN statement syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

or:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
WHERE condition;


A join operation combines the rows from two or more tables based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables. 
There are two types of table joins: inner joins and outer joins.

Inner Join

The most common type of join is an inner join, which displays only the rows from two tables that have matching value in a common column,
usually the primary key of one table that exists as a foreign key in the second table.

Outer Joins

Outer joins, like inner joins, return the rows from each table that have matching values in the join columns. 
Unlike inner joins, outer joins also return the rows that do not have a match between the tables.
SQL offers you three types of outer joins: left outer join, right outer join and full outer join. 
In a left outer join, all the rows from the first table (on the left side of the join predicate) are included, 
and only the matching rows from the second table (on the right side of the join predicate).

Full outer joins return all matching rows from both tables and all the rows from both tables that donâ€™t have a match.


How does a LEFT OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;



How does a RIGHT OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;



How does a FULL OUTER JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;



How does a SELF JOIN statement syntax look?

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
