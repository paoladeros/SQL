There are several ways to access multiple tables in the same query. 
Namely, using Sub-queries, Implicit JOIN, and JOIN operators, such as INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.


Implicit version of CROSS JOIN (also known as Cartesian Join) statement syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2;


Implicit version of INNER JOIN statement syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
