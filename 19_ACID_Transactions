ACID Transactions

A transaction is simply a sequence of operations performed using one or more SQL statements as a single logical unit of work. 
A database transaction must be ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable).
Atomic - All changes must be performed successfully or not at all. 
Consistent - Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction. 
Isolated - No other process can change the data while the transaction is running. 
Durable - The changes made by the transaction must persist.

To start an ACID transaction, use the command BEGIN.
Any commands you issue after that are part of the transaction, until you issue either COMMIT, or ROLLBACK. 
If all the commands complete successfully, issue a commit command to save everything in the database to a consistent, stable state.
If any of the commands fail, you can issue a rollback command to undo all the changes and leave the database in its previously consistent stable state.

SQL statements can be called from languages like Java, C, R, and Python. 
This requires the use of database-specific access APIs such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for Java or a specific database connector like ibm_db for Python.
