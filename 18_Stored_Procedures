Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored and executed on the database server. 
So instead of sending multiple SQL statements from the client to the server, 
you encapsulate them in a stored procedure on the server and send one statement from the client to execute them. 
Also, stored procedures can be useful if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again. 
You can save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it. 
In stored procedures, you can also pass parameters so that a stored procedure can act based on the passed parameter values.
